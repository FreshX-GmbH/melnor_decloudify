This replaces the wifiaquatimer.com cloud interface of the Melnor 4 channel Aqua Timer Smart (also known as Natrain)

This is done by DNS Spoofing the cloud entries and providing a compatible interface to the Smart Device.

Our code provides a simple rest API which allows you to run the Water Timer completely on premise without internet or cloud connection.

Have fun ...
